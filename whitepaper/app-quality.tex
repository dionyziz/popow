\appsection{Superchain Quality Distributions}
\label{sec.app-quality}

We now provide proofs that the definitions explored in Section~\ref{sec.quality}
regarding the distributions of superchains are attained.

\begin{restatable}[Local goodness]{lemma}{restateLemLocalGood}
\label{lem.localgood}
Assume $\chain$ contains only honestly-generated blocks in an optimistic
execution. For all levels $\mu$, for all constant $\delta > 0$, all continuous
subchains $\chain' = \chain[i:j]$ with $|\chain'| \geq m$ are locally good,
$\textsf{local-good}_{\delta}(\chain', \chain, \mu)$, with overwhelming
probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}
\import{./}{proofs/localgood.tex}

\begin{restatable}[Multilevel quality]{lemma}{restateLemMultilevel}
\label{lem.multilevel}
For all $\mu, 0 < \delta \leq 0.5$, chain $\chain$ containing only
honestly-generated blocks in an optimistic execution has $(\delta, k_1)$
multilevel quality at level $\mu$ with overwhelming probability in $k_1$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
Identical.
\Qed
\end{proof}

\begin{restatable}[Superquality]{lemma}{restateLemSuperquality}
\label{lem.superquality}
For all $\mu, \delta > 0$, a chain $\chain$ adopted in an optimistic execution
has $(\delta, m)$-superquality at level $\mu$ with overwhelming probability in
$m$.
\end{restatable}
\import{./}{proofs/superquality.tex}

\begin{restatable}[Optimistic superchain distribution]{lemma}{restateLemSuperchain}
\label{lem.superchain-distribution}
For any level $\mu$, and any $0 < \delta < 0.5$, a chain
$\chain$ containing only honestly-generated blocks adopted by an honest party in
an execution with random network scheduling is $(\delta, m)$-good at level
$\mu$ with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
This is a direct consequence of Lemma~\ref{lem.superquality} and
Lemma~\ref{lem.multilevel}. \Qed
\end{proof}
