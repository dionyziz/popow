\section*{Appendix}

Our Appendix is structured as follows.
% In Section~\ref{sec.forks}, we illustrate
% gradual deployment paths. One of our techniques allows adoption of our scheme
% without requiring miner consensus. We term this technique a \emph{velvet fork}
% in contrast to the classical \emph{soft} and \emph{hard forks} which require
% approval by a majority of miners. This technique is a novel contribution and may
% be of independent interest for other blockchain protocols.
Section~\ref{sec.variable} gives an intuition about creating a construction for
variable difficulty NIPoPoWs by modifying the construction presented in this
paper.
Section~\ref{sec.app-quality} gives the lemmas and associated proofs showing how
superchains are distributed. This provides the necessary tools to show that the
construction is optimistically succinct. Section~\ref{sec:attack-full} contains
the full formality of our attack against previous work, together with a proof
that our attack succeeds with overwhelming probability, given the correct
strategy and protocol parameters. Section~\ref{sec:security-full} gives a formal
proof of our security claims through a cryptographic reduction. Section~
\ref{sec.app-succinctness} includes the remaining proofs that were omitted from
the body of the paper with the goal of proving optimistic succinctness, a
central result of our paper. It also proves succinctness in more adversarial
settings, which is another novel contribution, as succinctness in any kind of
adversarial setting has not been explored in previous work. We conclude with
Section~\ref{sec.app-ico} which includes experimental data of our Solidity
implementation for the ICO application.
