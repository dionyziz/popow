% \section*{Appendix}
%
% Our Appendix is structured as follows.
% In Section~\ref{sec:forks}, we illustrate
% gradual deployment paths. One of our techniques allows adoption of our scheme
% without requiring miner consensus. We term this technique a \emph{velvet fork}
% in contrast to the classical \emph{soft} and \emph{hard forks} which require
% approval by a majority of miners. This technique is a novel contribution and may
% be of independent interest for other blockchain protocols.
% Section~\ref{sec:variable} gives an intuition about creating a construction for
% variable difficulty NIPoPoWs by modifying the construction presented in this
% paper.
% Section~\ref{sec:app-quality} gives the lemmas and associated proofs showing how
% superchains are distributed. This provides the necessary tools to show that the
% construction is optimistically succinct. Section~\ref{sec:attack-full} contains
% the full formal proof that our attack against our strawman construction succeeds with overwhelming probability, given the correct
% strategy and protocol parameters. Section~\ref{sec:security-full} gives a formal
% proof of our security claims through a computational reduction. Section~
% \ref{sec:app-succinctness} includes the remaining proofs that were omitted from
% the body of the paper with the goal of proving optimistic succinctness, a
% central result of our paper. It also proves succinctness in more adversarial
% settings. We conclude with
% Section~\ref{sec:app-ico} which includes experimental data of our Solidity
% implementation for the ICO application.
