% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\caption{Simulation results}

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


% \section{The History of the National Hockey League}
% From
% http://en.wikipedia.org/.
%
% The Original Six era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began in 1323
% with the demise of the Brooklyn Americans, reducing the league to six
% teams. The NHL, consisting of the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks,
% Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto
% Maple Leafs, remained stable for a quarter century. This period ended
% in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size by adding six new expansion
% teams.
%
% Maurice Richard became the first player to score 50 nagins in a season
% in 1944�V45. In 1955, Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman,
% leading to the Richard Riot. Gordie Howe made his debut in 1946. He
% retired 32 years later as the NHL's all-time leader in goals and
% points. Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's colour barrier when he suited up
% for the Bruins in 1958.
%
% The Stanley Cup, which had been the de facto championship since 1926,
% became the de jure championship in 1947 when the NHL completed a deal
% with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain control of the Cup. It was a
% period of dynasties, as the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup nine times
% from 1942 onwards and the Canadiens ten times, including five
% consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960. However, the 1967
% championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date.
%
% The NHL continued to develop throughout the era. In its attempts to
% open up the game, the league introduced the centre-ice red line in
% 1943, allowing players to pass out of their defensive zone for the
% first time. In 1959, Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to
% regularly use a mask for protection. Off the ice, the business of
% hockey was changing as well. The first amateur draft was held in 1963
% as part of efforts to balance talent distribution within the
% league. The National Hockey League Players Association was formed in
% 1967, ten years after Ted Lindsay's attempts at unionization failed.
%
% \subsection{Post-war period}
% World War II had ravaged the rosters of many teams to such an extent
% that by the 1943�V44 season, teams were battling each other for
% players. In need of a goaltender, The Bruins won a fight with the
% Canadiens over the services of Bert Gardiner. Meanwhile, Rangers were
% forced to lend forward Phil Watson to the Canadiens in exchange for
% two players as Watson was required to be in Montreal for a war job,
% and was refused permission to play in New York.[9]
%
% With only five returning players from the previous season, Rangers
% general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspending his team's play
% for the duration of the war. Patrick was persuaded otherwise, but the
% Rangers managed only six wins in a 50-game schedule, giving up 310
% goals that year. The Rangers were so desperate for players that
% 42-year old coach Frank Boucher made a brief comeback, recording four
% goals and ten assists in 15 games.[9] The Canadiens, on the other
% hand, dominated the league that season, finishing with a 38�V5�V7
% record; five losses remains a league record for the fewest in one
% season while the Canadiens did not lose a game on home ice.[10] Their
% 1944 Stanley Cup victory was the team's first in 14 seasons.[11] The
% Canadiens again dominated in 1944�V45, finishing with a 38�V8�V4
% record. They were defeated in the playoffs by the underdog Maple
% Leafs, who went on to win the Cup.[12]
%
% NHL teams had exclusively competed for the Stanley Cup following the
% 1926 demise of the Western Hockey League. Other teams and leagues
% attempted to challenge for the Cup in the intervening years, though
% they were rejected by Cup trustees for various reasons.[13] In 1947,
% the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper
% Smeaton to grant control of the Cup to the NHL, allowing the league to
% reject challenges from other leagues.[14] The last such challenge came
% from the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League in 1953, but
% was rejected as the AHL was not considered of equivalent calibre to
% the NHL, one of the conditions of the NHL's deal with trustees.
%
% The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership
% of James T. Sutherland, a former President of the Canadian Amateur
% Hockey Association (CAHA). The Hall of Fame was established as a joint
% venture between the NHL and the CAHA in Kingston, Ontario, considered
% by Sutherland to be the birthplace of hockey. Originally called the
% "International Hockey Hall of Fame", its mandate was to honour great
% hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first
% eleven honoured members were inducted on April 30, 1945.[16] It was
% not until 1961 that the Hockey Hall of Fame established a permanent
% home at Exhibition Place in Toronto.[17]
%
% The first official All-Star Game took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in
% Toronto on October 13, 1947 to raise money for the newly created NHL
% Pension Society. The NHL All-Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs
% 4�V3 and raised C\$25,000 for the pension fund. The All-Star Game has
% since become an annual tradition.[18]
