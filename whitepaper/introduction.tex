\section{Introduction}

Proof-of-work blockchain clients such as mobile wallets today are based on the
Simplified Payment Verifications (SPV) protocol, which was described in the
original Bitcoin paper~\cite{bitcoin}, and allows them to sychronize with the
network by downloading only block headers and not the entire blockchain with
transactions. However, such initial synchronization still requires receiving all
the block headers. In this work, we study the question of whether better
protocols exist and in particular if downloading fewer block headers is
sufficient to securely synchronize with the rest of the blockchain network. Our
requirement is that the system remains decentralized and that useful facts about
the blockchain (such as the Merkle root of current account balances in
Ethereum~\cite{wood,vitalik}) can be deduced from the downloaded data.

\noindent\textbf{Our contributions.}
We put forth a cryptographic security definition for
Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work protocols which describes what such a
synchronization protocol must achieve (Section~\ref{sec:model}). We then
construct a protocol which solves the problem and requires sending only a
logarithmic number of blocks from the chain. We construct a protocol which can
synchronize recent blocks, the \emph{suffix proofs} protocol
(Section~\ref{sec:suffix}).
We analyze the security and succinctness of
our protocol in Section~\ref{sec:security}.
In the Appendix, we show a simple addition to the suffix proofs protocol
which allows synchronizing any part of the blockchain that the client may be
interested in, the \emph{infix proofs} protocol (Section~\ref{sec:infix}).
We give formal proofs of security and succinctness, provide
concrete parameters for the implementation of our scheme, present applications
beyond superlight clients including cross-chain applications, propose a mechanism with which our scheme can
be deployed to existing cryptocurrencies without a fork, and propose
a variable difficulty construction.

%% Today, Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the two largest proof-of-work
%% cryptocurrencies by market cap. However, the ecosystem has grown diverse, with
%% dozens of viable ``altcoin'' competitors.
%% %
%% Given such an environment,  it becomes increasingly  important to be able to
%% efficiently handle  multiple blockchains by the same client and reliably
%% transfer assets between them.
%
%
%
%We envision our NIPoPoW protocol will form the basis of an
%efficient multi-blockchain client, which could efficiently support payments
%using hundreds of different cryptocurrencies.
%Our protocol improves the performance of client.
%blockchain protocols in general
%are increasingly used as components of larger systems.

% The first objective requires optimizing the ``SPV client'' described in the
% original Bitcoin paper~\cite{bitcoin} which requires processing an amount of
% data growing linearly with the size of the blockchain (namely, the block
% headers).
%
%% Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin}\cite{bitcoinsoftware} and
%% Ethereum~\cite{ethereum} are peer-to-peer networks that maintain a globally
%% consistent transaction ledger, using a consensus protocol based on proof-of-work
%% (PoW) puzzles~\cite{pow,hashcash}. Worker nodes called ``miners'' expend
%% computational work in order to reach agreement on the state of the network.
%% Clients on the network, such as mobile phone apps, must verify these
%% PoWs in order to determine the correct view of the network's state, something necessary
%% to transmit and receive payments correctly.

%% In this work we introduce, analyze and instantiate a new primitive,
%% Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs), which can be adapted into
%% existing cryptocurrencies to support more efficient clients. A traditional
%% blockchain client in order to check a certain blockchain property \anote{TODO: too abstract
%
% The second objective has received  significant attention in the context of
% ``cross-chain'' applications, i.e., logical transactions that span multiple
% separate blockchains. Simple cross-chain transactions are feasible today: the
% most well-known is the atomic exchange~\cite{tiernolan,herlihy2018atomic}, e.g.,
% a trade of bitcoin for ether. However, more sophisticated
% applications~
% \cite{interledger,DBLP:journals/corr/DilleyPWPGF16,
%       lerner,drivechains,wood2016polkadot,buchman2016tendermint}
% could be enabled by a more efficient proof process, which would allow the
% blockchain of one cryptocurrency to embed a client of a separate cryptocurrency.
% This concept, initially popularized by a proposal by Back et al.
% ~\cite{sidechains} can be used to avoid a difficult upgrade process: a new
% blockchain with additional features, such as experimental opcodes, can be backed
% by deposits in the original bitcoin currency, obviating the need to transfer
% capital to the new cryptocurrency. As one example of cross-chain interfacing, we
% describe an initial coin offering (ICO)~\cite{ico} which distributes tokens
% issued on one blockchain, but allows paying for them using coins in another
% blockchain.

% These examples illustrate that our solution is a key component for two important
% pillars needed for next-generation blockchains: \emph{interoperability} and
% \emph{scalability}. While we use bitcoin concretely as an example, any
% proof-of-work cryptocurrency can adopt our techniques.

% \noindent
% \textbf{Our contributions.}
% Our main technical contribution is the introduction and instantiation of a new
% cryptographic primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work
% (NIPoPoWs).
%
% We present a formal model and a provably secure instantiation of NIPoPoWs. We
% introduce the first formal security definitions of NIPoPoW protocols and their
% security. Our proofs are in the Bitcoin backbone model~\cite{backbone}. Our
% construction is the first secure Proof of Proof-of-Work (regardless of
% interactivity), assuming honest majority. Furthermore, our solution is
% non-interactive making it the first protocol of this kind.
%
% We encode events and other information that is useful to blockchain clients in
% the form of \emph{blockchain predicates}. We describe a large class of
% predicates that can be proven which we call \emph{infix sensitive}. This enables
% proving statements pertaining to the blockchain such as the fact that a
% transaction took place (for payment verification), that a smart contract method
% ran with certain parameters, or that a payment was made into an account.
%
% We prove the proofs are optimistically succinct meaning that they are
% logarithmic in size in honest conditions. We show that, in the optimistic model
% of no adversarial mining power, succinctness can be achieved for even
% \emph{adversarially-generated} proofs.
%
% We provide concrete parameterization and empirical analysis showing the savings
% of our approach versus existing clients.
%
% In the Appendix, we propose a novel gradual deployment path for our scheme which
% we term a \emph{velvet fork} and which can provide the benefits of our scheme
% without requiring miner adoption unlike typical \emph{hard} or \emph{soft
% forks}. This technique may be of independent interest for other protocols.
%
% In summary, we make the following contributions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item We construct the first \emph{provably secure} Proofs of Proof-of-Work
%         and give a formal definition of security. We make them
%         \emph{non-interactive}.
%   \item We model \emph{blockchain predicates} and show which classes of
%         predicates can be proven using our protocol.
%   \item We create the first decentralized protocol which is secure against all
%         adversaries and \emph{succinct} for non-mining adversaries.
%   \item We provide \emph{experimental data} which measure the efficiency and
%         security of our scheme as well as concrete parameters based on these
%         experiments.
% \end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Previous work.} The need for succinct clients was first identified by
Nakamoto in his original paper~\cite{bitcoin}. Predicates pertaining to events
occurring in the blockchain have been explored in the setting of
sidechains~\cite{sidechains}. It has
also been implemented for simple classes of predicates such as atomic
swaps~\cite{tiernolan,herlihy2018atomic}, which do not allow full
synchronization. Non-succinct certificates about proof-of-\emph{stake}
blockchains have been proposed in~\cite{gazi2019proof}, but their scheme is not
applicable to proof-of-\emph{work}. Superblocks were first described in the Bitcoin Forum~\cite{highway} and later formalized~\cite{KLS} to describe their \emph{Proofs of Proof-of-Work} which have limited applications due to interactivity, lack of security, and inability to prove facts buried deep within the blockchain. We improve upon their work with a security definition, an interactive construction, and an attack against their scheme which works with overwhelming probability.
