\begin{proof}
    Because $\mu_B$ is the compared level of the honest party we have
    $2^{\mu_B}|\chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}| > 2^{\mu_B}|\chain\{b:\}|$.
    The proof is by contradiction. Suppose $\mu_B' < \mu_B$.
    By definition, $\mu_B'$ is the maximum level such that
    $|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^\mu[1:]| \geq \max(m, (1 -
    \delta)2^{-\mu}|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^\mu[1:]\downchain|)$, therefore
    $\mu_B$ does not satisfy this condition. But we know that
    $|\pi_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}[1:]| \geq m$ because $\mu_B$ was selected by
    the Verifier. Therefore
    $2^{\mu_B}|\chain_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B}| < (1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}|$.
    But $\mu_B'$ satisfies goodness, so
    $2^{\mu_B'}|\chain_B\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B'}| > (1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}|$.
    From the last two equations, we obtain
    $(1 - \delta)|\chain\{b:\}| > 2^{\mu_B'}|\chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu_B'}|$,
    which contradicts the previous equation.
    \Qed
