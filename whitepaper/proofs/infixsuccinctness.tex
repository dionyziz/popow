\begin{proof}
As long as the number of blocks on which the predicate depends is
polylogarithmic ($< d$) with respect to the chain length, our proofs remain
succinct. Specifically, the proof size for the suffix has exactly the same size.
Then the part of the proof that is of interest is the output of the followDown
algorithm. However, notice that this algorithm will on average produce as many
blocks as the difference of levels between $B'$ and $E$, which is at most
logarithmic in the chain size. Hence the proof sizes will be in expectation $(m +
|\chain'|)\log(|\chain|)$, which remains succinct if $|\chain'| \in
O(polylog(|\chain|))$.
\Qed
\end{proof}
