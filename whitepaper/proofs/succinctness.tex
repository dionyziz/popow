\begin{proof}
    Assume $\chain$ is the honest parties chain. From \ref{thm.few-levels}, the
    number of levels in the NIPoPoW is at most $\log(|\chain|)$ with
    overwhelming probability in $m$.

    First, observe that the count of blocks in the highest level will be less
    than $4m$ from Theorem~\ref{thm.large-expansion}; otherwise a higher
    superblock level would exist. Then for the $m$-long suffix of each
    superchain of level $\mu$, the supporting superchain of level $\mu - 1$
    will have at most $4m$ blocks from Corollary~\ref{crly.small-support}.

    Therefore the size of the proof is $4m \log(|\chain|)$, which is succinct.
\end{proof}
