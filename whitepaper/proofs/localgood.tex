\begin{proof} \textbf{(Sketch)}
Observing that for each honestly generated block the probability of being a
$\mu$-superblock for any level $\mu$ follows an independent Bernoulli
distribution, we can apply a Chernoff bound to show that the number of
superblocks within a chain will be close to its expectation, which is what
is required for local goodness.
