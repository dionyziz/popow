\begin{proof}
    From Theorem~\ref{thm.succinctness} we know that the proofs $\pi$ contain
    only a $O(poly\-log(m))$ amount of blocks. For each of these blocks, the
    velvet client needs to include a followUp tail of blocks. Assume a
    percentage $0 < g \leq 1$ of miners have upgraded with NIPoPoW support.
    Then the question of whether each block in the honest chain is upgraded
    follows a Bernoulli distribution. If the velvet proof were to be larger
    than $\Delta$ times the soft fork proof in the number of blocks included,
    then this would require at least one of the followUp tails to include at
    least $\Delta$ sequential unupgraded blocks. But since the upgrade status
    of each block is independent, the probability of this occurring is
    $g^\Delta$, which is negligible in $\Delta$.
    \Qed
