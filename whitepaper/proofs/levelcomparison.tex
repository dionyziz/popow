\begin{proof}
    From $|\chain'_\mathcal{A}| \geq k$ we know that $Z^\mu(S) \geq k$. From the
    definition of typicality, we have $|S| \geq (1 -
    \epsilon')2^{\mu_A}\frac{1}{pqt}|\chain'_\mathcal{A}|$.
    Applying the chain growth theorem \cite{backbone} we obtain that $|\chain_B^S|
    \geq (1 - \epsilon)f|S|$. But from the goodness of $\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}$, we
    know that $|\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}| \geq (1 -
    \delta)2^{-\mu_B}|\chain_B^S|$. Therefore $|\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}| \geq
    2^{-\mu_B}(1 - \delta)(1 - \epsilon)f(1 -
    \epsilon')2^{\mu_\mathcal{A}}\frac{1}{pqt}|\chain'_\mathcal{A}|$ and so
    $2^{\mu_\mathcal{A}}|\chain'_\mathcal{A}|
    <
    \frac{pqt}{(1 - \delta)(1 -
    \epsilon')(1 - \epsilon)f}2^{\mu_B}|\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}|$.
    \Qed

% TODO: The 1/3 doesn't follow by allowing \epsilon' to take any value.
% The two chains (adversarial and honest) grow at their own pace and their
% relative rates will be maintained -- hence their relative sizes will be
% bounded by the ratio of adversarial / honest power.
% An adversary assumption of 1/4 is required.
