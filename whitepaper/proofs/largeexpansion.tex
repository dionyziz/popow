\begin{proof}
    Assume the $(\mu - 1)$-level superchain has $4m$ blocks. Because each block
    of level $\mu - 1$ was generated as a query to the random oracle, it
    constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial and the number of blocks in level
    $\mu$, namely $\pi\upchain^\mu$, is a Binomial distribution with parameters
    $(4m, 1/2)$. Clearly
    $\Pr[|\pi\upchain^\mu| = m] \leq \Pr[|\pi\upchain^\mu| \leq m]$. Observing
    that $E[\pi\upchain^\mu] = 2m$ and applying a Chernoff bound, we get
    $\Pr[|\pi\upchain^\mu| \leq (1 - \frac{1}{2})2m] \leq \exp(-\frac{(1/2)^2}{2}
    2m)$ which is negligible in $m$.

    This probability bounds the probability of fewer than $m$ blocks occurring
    in the $\mu$ level restriction of $(\mu - 1)$-level superchains of more than
    $4m$ blocks.
\end{proof}
