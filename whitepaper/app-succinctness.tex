\section{More on succinctness}
\label{sec.app-succinctness}

\subsection{Proof of succinctness}
We now prove the optimistic succinctness claims of
Section~\ref{sec.succinctness}.

\begin{restatable}[Number of levels]{theorem}{restateThmFewLevels}
    \label{thm.few-levels}
    In any execution, let $S$ denote the set of all blocks produced honestly or
    adversarially. The number of superblock levels which have at least $m$
    blocks are at most $\log(|S|)$, with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}[Large upchain expansion]{theorem}{restateThmLargeExpansion}
    \label{thm.large-expansion}
    Consider an optimistic execution and let $\chain$ be an honestly adopted
    chain and let $\chain' = \chain\upchain^{\mu - 1}[i:i + 4m]$ for any $i$.
    Then $|\chain'\upchain^\mu| \geq m$ with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}
\import{./}{proofs/largeexpansion.tex}

\begin{restatable}[Small downchain support]{lemma}{restateThmSmallSupport}
    \label{lem.small-support}
    Consider an optimistic execution and let $\chain$ be an honestly adopted
    chain and $\chain' = \chain\upchain^\mu[i:i + m]$. Then
    $|\chain'\downchain\upchain^{\mu - 1}| \leq 4m$ with overwhelming
    probability in $m$.

% \subsection{Succinctness of adversarial proofs}
% In the stronger adversarial setting, however, it is possible for the adversary
% to produce large dummy (incorrect) proofs that expand the verification time;
% security will not be hurt but it would take more time to complete verification.
% One may dismiss this as a trivial denial of service attack and have a resource
% bounded verifier simply stop if it is confronted with such a processing task.
% However, simply dismissing superpolylogarithmic proofs is an incorrect strategy,
% as honest provers can produce such longer proofs in case an adversarial miner
% harms the goodness of the blockchain.
%
% It would therefore be useful for honest provers to have the ability to
% signal to the verifier that such time expansion is indeed necessary because of
% an attack on superchain quality, rather than because a malicious prover is
% simply sending long proofs that will eventually be rejected. With such signaling
% mechanism, a resource bounded verifier can distinguish between a denial of
% service attack that may be directed solely to it from  a denial of service
% attack that  is launched by an attacker that has the ability to  interfere
% globally with superchain quality.
%
% To facilitate the above signaling, we offer a simple generalization of our
% construction that achieves this. Our extended construction allows the verifier
% to stop processing input early, in a streaming fashion, thereby only requiring
% logarithmic communication complexity per proof received. To achieve this,
% observe that honest proofs need to be large only if there is a violation of
% \textit{goodness}. However, goodness is not harmed when the chain is not under
% attack by the adversarial computational power or network. So, we require
% the prover to produce a \textit{certificate of badness} in case there is a
% violation of \textit{goodness} in the blockchain. This certificate will always
% be logarithmic in size and must be sent prior to the rest of the proof by the
% prover to the verifier. Because the certificate will be logarithmic in size even
% in the case of an adversarial attack on the chain, the honest verifier can stop
% processing the certificate after a logarithmic time bound. If the certificate is
% claimed to be longer, the honest verifier can reject early by deciding that the
% prover is adversarial. Looking at the certificate, the honest verifier
% determines whether there is a possibility for a lack of goodness in the
% underlying chain. If there's no adversarial computational power in use, the
% certificate is impossible to produce.
%
% The certificates of badness are produced easily as follows. First, the honest
% verifier finds the maximum level $\text{max-}\mu$ at which there are at least
% $m$ $\text{max-}\mu$-superblocks and includes it in the certificate. Then,
% because there is a violation of goodness there must exist two levels $\mu <
% \mu'$ such that $2^\mu|\chain\upchain^\mu| > (1 +
% \delta)2^{\mu'}|\chain\upchain^{\mu'}|$ in some part $\chain$ of the honestly
% adopted chain. But $\mu' - \mu \leq \text{max-}\mu$. Therefore, there must exist
% two adjacent levels $\mu_1 < \mu_2$ which break goodness but with error
% parameter $(1 + \delta)^{1/{\text{max-}\mu}}$. In particular, it will hold that
% $2^{\mu_1}|\chain\upchain^{\mu_1}| > (1 +
% \delta)^{1/{\text{max-}\mu}}2^{\mu_2}|\chain\upchain^{\mu_2}|$. This condition
% is direct for the prover to find and trivial for the verifier to check and
% completes the construction. Note that it is possible that a certificate of
% badness is produceable where two adjacent levels have more than $(1 +
% \delta)^{1/{\text{max-}\mu}}$ error even if there is no harm to global goodness;
% however, these certificates cannot be produced when no adversarial power is in
% use. The algorithm to do this is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg.badness}.
%
% \import{./}{algorithms/alg.badness.tex}
%
% Therefore, we augment the NIPoPoW construction as follows. The honest prover
% sends a tuple of two items. The first item is empty if the second item is
% polylogarithmic in the size of the chain; otherwise it is a certificate of
% badness. The second item is the NIPoPoW proof as in the previous construction.
% The verifier processes only the first polylogarithmic number of bytes from the
% incoming proof. If within that portion a certificate of badness is found, it is
% checked for validity. If it is found to be valid, the whole proof is checked,
% regardless of size. If it is found to be invalid or no certificate has been
% provided, then the proof is rejected as invalid. We call the augmented
% construction \textit{certified NIPoPoWs}.
%
% \begin{restatable}[Certified NIPoPoWs succinctness]{lemma}{restateLemCertifiedSuccinctness}
%     \label{lem.certified-succinctness}
%     If all miners are honest and the network scheduling is random,
%     certified non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work produced by the adversary
%     are processed in polylogarithmic time in the size of the chain by honest
%     verifiers, except with negligible probability in $m$.
% \end{restatable}
% \begin{proof}
%     Because all miners are honest and the network scheduling is random,
%     therefore certificates of badness exist with negligible probability in $m$.
%     Conditioning on the event that certificates of badness do not exist, the
%     honest verifier will reject the proof in polylogarithmic time.
%     \Qed
% \end{proof}
%
% We also establish that the modified construction does not harm security below.
% Security is established in the general case where the adversary has minority
% mining power.
%
% \begin{theorem}[Certified NIPoPoWs security]
%     Assuming honest majority, certified non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work
%     are secure, except with negligible probability in $\kappa$.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%     We distinguish two cases: Either goodness has been violated; or it has not
%     been violated. Suppose that goodness has been violated. In that case, an
%     honest prover will include a certificate of badness in their proof and their
%     proof will be processed by an honest verifier.
%
%     In the case where goodness is not violated, all honest proofs will be
%     logarithmic in size as established by
%     Lemma~\ref{lem.certified-succinctness}. Therefore, all honest proofs will
%     be processed by an honest verifier.
%
%     Under the condition that all honest proofs will be processed, the rest of
%     the security argument follows immediately from Theorem~\ref{thm.security}.
%     \Qed
% \end{proof}
%
% We note that, compared to previous work~\cite{KLS}, the adversarial model in
% which we have proven our succinctness is stronger in that the adversary is able
% to produce proofs.

\subsection{Infix succinctness}
Having established the succinctness of the modified suffix construction, the
succinctness of the infix construction follows in the next corollary.

\begin{restatable}{corollary}{restateCrlyInfixSuccinctness}
\label{thm.infix-succinctness}
The infix NIPoPoW protocol $(P, V)$ is succinct for all computable
infix-sensitive $k$-stable predicates $Q$ in which the witness predicate $D$
depends on a \emph{polylogarithmic} number of blocks $d(|\chain|)$.
