\subsection{Succinctness}

We now prove that our construction produces succinct proofs.

\begin{restatable}[Few levels]{theorem}{restateThmFewLevels}
    \label{thm.few-levels}
    The number of superblock levels which have at least $m$ blocks are at most
    $\log(|S|)$, where $S$ is the set of all blocks produced, with overwhelming
    probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/fewlevels.tex}
\fi

The above theorem establishes that the number of superchains is small. What
remains to be shown is that few blocks will be included at each superchain
level.

\begin{restatable}[Large upchain expansion]{theorem}{restateThmLargeExpansion}
    \label{thm.large-expansion}
    Let $\chain$ be an honestly generated chain and let
    $\chain' = \chain\upchain^{\mu - 1}[i:i + \ell]$ with $\ell \geq 4m$.
    Then:

    \begin{equation}
      |\chain'\upchain^\mu| \geq m
    \end{equation}

    with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/largeexpansion.tex}
\fi

\begin{restatable}[Small downchain support]{corollary}{restateThmSmallSupport}
    \label{crly.small-support}
    Assume an honestly generated chain $\chain$ and let $\chain' = \chain\upchain^\mu[i:i + m]$. Then:

    \begin{equation}
      |\chain'\downchain\upchain^{\mu - 1}| \leq 4m
    \end{equation}

    with overwhelming probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

\ifonecolumn
\import{./}{proofs/smallsupport.tex}
\fi

This last theorem establishes the fact that the support of blocks needed under
the $m$-sized chain suffix to move from one level to the one below is small.
Based on this, we can establish our theorem on succinctness:

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{restateThmSuccinctness}
    \label{thm.succinctness}
    Non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work produced by honest provers on
    honestly generated chains with random scheduling are succinct with the
    number of blocks bounded by $4m \log(|\chain|)$, with overwhelming
    probability in $m$.
\end{restatable}

Full proofs of these facts are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec.proofs}.
