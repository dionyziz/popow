Most cryptocurrencies use proof-of-work (PoW) to construct blockchains and arrive at consensus. In this work, we construct a new primitive called Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) that can be adapted into existing PoW-based cryptocurrencies to improve their performance. Unlike a traditional (full or SPV) blockchain client which must verify the entire linearly-growing chain of PoWs when ran after a long period of inactivity, clients based on NIPoPoWs require resources only logarithmic in the length of the blockchain. NIPoPoWs are thus \emph{succinct} proofs and require only a single message between the prover and the verifier of the transaction. Our proofs allow proving that a transaction buried deep within a blockchain has been confirmed, as well as a wide class of predicates about other blockchain events. Our scheme is provably secure in the Bitcoin Backbone model under Random Oracle.
The main application of our scheme is to build \emph{superlight} clients which perform much better than traditional light bitcoin clients based on SPV such as today's mobile wallets. We provide empirical validation for NIPoPoWs through an implementation and benchmark study in the context of the superlight clients application. Finally, using our experimental data, we provide concrete parameters for our scheme which can be used by implementors.
