\section{Security}
\label{sec:security}

We state our main theorem and give a sketch of its proof here. The full proof is
given in the full version of our paper.

\begin{restatable}[Security]{theorem}{restateThmSecurity}
    \label{thm.security}
    Assuming honest majority and an execution in which superblock density is
    $\delta$-close to expectation for some positive $\delta$, the
    Non-interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work construction for computable
    $k$-stable monotonic suffix-sensitive predicates is secure with overwhelming
    probability in $\kappa$.
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Suppose an adversary produces a proof $\pi_\mathcal{A}$ and an honest
party produces a proof $\pi_B$ such that the two proofs cause the predicate $Q$
to evaluate to different values, while at the same time all honest parties have
agreed that the correct value is the one obtained by $\pi_B$. Because of
Bitcoin's security, $\mathcal{A}$ will be unable to make these claims for an
actual underlying 0-level chain.

We now argue that the operator $\leq_m$ will
signal in favour of the honest parties.
Suppose $b$ is the LCA block between $\pi_\mathcal{A}$ and $\pi_B$. If the chain
forks at $b$, there can be no more adversarial blocks after $b$ than honest
blocks after $b$, provided there are at least $k$ honest blocks (due to the
Common Prefix property). We will now argue that, further, there can be no more
disjoint $\mu_\mathcal{A}$-level superblocks than honest $\mu_B$-level
superblocks after $b$.

To see this, let $b$ be an honest block generated at some round $r_1$ and let
the honest proof be generated at some round $r_3$. Then take the sequence
of consecutive rounds $S = (r_1, \cdots, r_3)$. Because the verifier requires at
least $m$ blocks from each of the provers, the adversary must have $m$
$\mu_\mathcal{A}$-superblocks in $\pi_\mathcal{A}\{b:\}$ which are not in
$\pi_B\{b:\}$. Therefore, using a negative binomial tail bound argument, we see
that $|S|$ must be long; intuitively, it takes a long time to produce a lot of
blocks $|\pi_\mathcal{A}\{b:\}|$. Given that $|S|$ is long and that the honest
parties have more mining power, they must have been able to produce a longer
$\pi_B\{b:\}$ argument (of course, this comparison will have the superchain
lengths weighted by $2^{\mu_\mathcal{A}}, 2^{\mu_B}$ respectively). To prove
this, we use a binomial tail bound argument; intuitively, given a long time
$|S|$, a lot of $\mu_B$-superblocks $|\pi_B\{b:\}|$ will have been honestly
produced.

We therefore have a fixed value for the length of the adversarial argument, a
negative binomial random variable for the number of rounds, and a binomial
random variable for the length of the honest argument. By taking the
expectations of the above random variables and applying a Chernoff bound, we see
that the actual values will be close to their means with overwhelming
probability, completing the proof.

\begin{remark}[Goodness]
  One of the conditions of the above theorem is that superblocks within the
  blockchain are distributed close to their expectation. While it has been
  experimentally verified that this is the
  case~\cite{compactsuperblocks,gtklocker}, we provide a version of the protocol
  which is provably secure even if this condition does not hold in the full
  version of our paper. We remark that large deviations from such expectation
  are detectable by the honest provers.
