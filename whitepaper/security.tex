\subsection{Security}

We will call a query to the random oracle $\mu$-\textit{successful} if the
random oracle returns a value $h$ such that $h \leq 2^{-\mu}T$.

In order to prove our construction secure, we first define the boolean random
variables $X_r^\mu$, $Y_r^\mu$ and $Z_r^\mu$, akin to the random variables
$X_r$, $Y_r$ and $Z_r$ of the backbone setting\cite{backbone}. For each round
$r$ and for each query index $j$ and for each $k$ adversarial party index (out
of $t$), define these random variables as follows.  If at round $i$ an honest
party obtains a PoW with $id < 2^{-\mu}T$, then $X_r^\mu = 1$, otherwise
$X_r^\mu = 0$. If at round $r$ exactly one honest party obtains a PoW with $id <
2^{-\mu}T$, then $Y_r^\mu = 1$, otherwise $Y_r^\mu = 0$. Regarding the
adversary, if at round $r$ the $j$-th query of the $k$-th corrupted party is
$\mu$-successful, then $Z^\mu_{ijk} = 1$, otherwise $Z^\mu_{ijk} = 0$. Further
define $Z^\mu_r = \sum_{k=1}^t \sum_{j=1}^q Z^\mu_{ijk}$, where $q$ denotes the
total number of queries. For a set of rounds $S$, let $X^\mu(S) = \sum_{r \in S}
X_r$ and similarly define $Y^\mu(S)$ and $Z^\mu(S)$.

We now extend the definition of a \textit{typical execution} from the backbone
setting\cite{backbone}.

\begin{definition}{(Typical execution)}
    An execution of the protocol is $(\epsilon, \eta)$-\textit{typical} if:

    \textnormal{\bf Block counts don't deviate.}
    For all $\mu \geq 0$ it holds that for any set $S$ of consecutive rounds
    with $|S| \geq 2^\mu \eta\kappa$, the following hold:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(1 - \epsilon)E[X^\mu(S)] < X^\mu(S) < (1 + \epsilon)E[X^\mu(S)]$ and $(1 - \epsilon)E[Y^\mu(S)] < Y^\mu(s)$.
        \item $Z^\mu(S) < (1 + \epsilon)E[Z^\mu(S)]$.
    \end{itemize}

    \textnormal{\bf Round count doesn't deviate.}
    Let $S$ be a set of consecutive rounds such that $Z^\mu(S)
    \geq k$ for some security parameter $k$. Then we have that $|S| \geq (1 -
    \epsilon)2^\mu\frac{k}{pqt}$ with overwhelming probability in $k$.

    \textnormal{\bf Chain regularity.}
    No insertions, no copies, and no predictions \cite{backbone} have occurred.
\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}[Typicality]{theorem}{restateThmTypicality}
\label{thm.typicality}
Executions are $(\epsilon, \eta)$-typical with overwhelming
probability in $\kappa$.

The following lemma is at the heart of the security proof that will follow.

% \aknote{It might be better if instead of $\chain'_\mathcal{A}$
% you just count the number of $\mu_\mathcal{A}$ blocks the adversary produced.}

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{restateThmLevelComparison}\label{lem.level-comparison}
    Suppose $S$ is a set of consecutive rounds $r_1 \ldots r_2$
    and $\chain_B$ is
    a chain adopted by an honest party at round $r_2$ of a typical execution.
    Let $\chain_B^S = \{b \in
    \chain_B: b \textnormal{ was generated during } S\}$. Let $\mu_\mathcal{A},
    \mu_B \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}$ is good.
    Suppose $\chain'_\mathcal{A}$ is a $\mu_\mathcal{A}$-superchain containing
    only adversarially generated blocks generated during $S$ and suppose that
    $|\chain'_\mathcal{A}| \geq k$.
    Then:

    \begin{equation*}
    2^{\mu_\mathcal{A}}|\chain'_\mathcal{A}| < \frac{1}{3}2^{\mu_B}|\chain_B^S\upchain^{\mu_B}|
    \end{equation*}
\end{restatable}

\begin{definition}[Adequate level of honest proof]
Let $\pi$ be an honestly generated proof constructed upon some adopted chain
$\chain$ and let $b \in \pi$.

Then $\mu'$ is defined as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\mu' = \max\{\mu: |\pi\{b:\}\upchain^\mu| \geq \max(m + 1, (1 -
\delta)2^{-\mu}|\pi\{b:\}\upchain^\mu\downchain|)\}
\end{equation*}

We call $\mu'$ the \textit{adequate} level of proof $\pi$ with respect to
block $b$ with security parameters $\delta$ and $m$. Note that the adequate
level of a proof is a function of both the proof $\pi$ and the chosen block $b$.
\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{restateThmAllBlocks}\label{lem.allblocks}
Let $\pi$ be some honest proof generated with security parameters $\delta, m$.
Let $\chain$ be the underlying chain, $b \in \chain$ be any block and $\mu'$ be
the adequate level of the proof with respect to $b$ and the same security
parameters.

Then $\chain\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'} = \pi\{b:\}\upchain^{\mu'}$.

% \aknote{maybe we need a definition of the ``compared level'' }

\begin{restatable}{restateThmLevelAdequacy}{lemma}
Suppose the verifier evaluates $\pi_\mathcal{A} \geq \pi_B$ in a protocol
interaction where $B$ is honest and assume during the comparison that the
compared level of the honest party is $\mu_B$. Let $b =
\textsf{LCA}(\pi_\mathcal{A}, \pi_B)$ and let $\mu_B'$ be the adequate
level of $\pi_B$ with respect to $b$. Then $\mu_B' \geq \mu_B$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{restateThmSecurity}
    \label{thm.security}
    The non-interactive proofs-of-proof-of-work construction for $k$-stable
    suffix-sensitive predicates is secure with overwhelming probability in
    $\kappa$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{remark}[Variance attacks]
    \label{rmk.variance}
    The critical issue addressed by this security proof is to avoid Bahack-style
    attack \cite{bahack} where the adversary constructs ``lucky'' high-difficulty
    superblocks without filling in the underlying proof-of-work in the lower
    levels. Observe that, while setting $m = 1$ ``preserves'' the proof-of-work in
    the sense that expectations remain the same, the probability of an adversarial
    attack becomes approximately proportional to the adversary power if the
    adversary follows a suitable strategy (for a description of such a strategy,
    see the parametrization section). With higher values of $m$, the probability of
    an adversarial attack drops exponentially, even though they maintain constant
    computational power, and hence satisfy a strong notion of security.
