\subsection{Multi-blockchain wallets.}
As mentioned, one application of our technique is the potential for a multi-cryptocurrency client.

At the current time of writing, a total of 731 cryptocurrencies are listed on 
\url{https://coinmarketcap.com/}.

Multiple online services provide access to multiple cryptocurrencies. These come with the drawback of relying on a third party.
Similarly, many multi-asset wallet applications, such as Jaxx\footnote{\url{https://jaxx.io/}} and Coinomi\footnote{\url{https://coinomi.com/}} do not connect to the peer-to-peer networks.

\end{table}

In Table 1, we show the costs associated with running a client supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. Our estimates are based on an assumption that the header for each block is 80 bytes, as is the case with Bitcoin. For EtHash based currencies, this is an underestimate, since according to the Ethereum whitepaper,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper}}
the header of an Ethereum block is approximately 200 bytes.

\subsection{More Applications}

\paragraph{Catena.}

In Catena,~\cite{} propose development of.

Develop a header relay network as a way of releasing.
If relay header network instead provided proofs based on NiPoPoWs,
