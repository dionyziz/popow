\section{Implementation and Parametrization}
In this section

\subsection{Prototype Implementation}
We provide an implementation of our protocol in Python. Our protocol consists of a prover, 
Our simulation evalute the

\subsection{Concrete Parameterization}
In this section we work through an example of choosing concreter parameters for our scheme.

We make two assumptions.

First, as in all Backbone-based security models, we must make an assumption that a majority of the network's overall hashpower is honest. Letting $\alpha$ represent an assumed bound on the strength of an adversary,
we require at most $\alpha < \frac{1}{2}$.
We take $\alpha = 20\%$.

We must make an assumption about the strength (in hashpower) that we can tolerate.

\section{Integration Scenarios}

In this section we discussion several integration scenarios that can benefit.

\subsection{Upgrade Paths}

\paragraph{Proof of Stake.}

\subsection{Application Scenarios}

\paragraph{Multi-blockchain wallets.}
As mentioned, one application of our technique is the potential for a multi-cryptocurrency client.

At the current time of writing, a total of 731 cryptocurrencies are listed on 
\url{https://coinmarketcap.com/}.

Multiple online services provide access to multiple cryptocurrencies. These come with the drawback of relying on a third party.
Similarly, many multi-asset wallet applications, such as Jaxx\footnote{\url{https://jaxx.io/}} and Coinomi\footnote{\url{https://coinomi.com/}} do not connect to the peer-to-peer networks.

Two obstacles. First, require making multiple connections to the peer-to-peer network.


\paragraph{Catena.}

In Catena, propose development of.

Develop a header relay network as a way of releasing.

\paragraph{BTCRelay.}
BTCRelay~\cite{btcrelay} is an Ethereum smart contract written in Ethereum that acts as an SPV client for the Bitcoin blockchain.
This allows an Ethereum smart contract to act .

Users can interact with the client to submit itcoin
